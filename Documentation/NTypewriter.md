## NTypewriter, nuget

### Build your own CLI

There is no official CLI version of NTypewriter, you can build your own easily since NTypewriter does not require the presence of VisualStudio. The hardest part is to acquire a valid instance of `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Compilation`, but [Buildalyzer
](https://github.com/daveaglick/Buildalyzer) will help with that. 

#### Nugets

To do that you will need a few nugets:

https://www.nuget.org/packages/NTypewriter/

https://www.nuget.org/packages/NTypewriter.CodeModel.Roslyn/

https://www.nuget.org/packages/Buildalyzer.Workspaces/

#### Example

And how to do that you can see here:

[DocumentationGenerator/Program.cs](../DocumentationGenerator/Program.cs)

The documentation page for "CodeModel" is generated by the above CLI program.
