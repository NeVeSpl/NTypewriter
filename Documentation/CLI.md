There is no official CLI version of NTypewriter, but you can build your own easily since NTypewriter does not require the presence of VisualStudio.

To do that you will need a few nugets:

https://www.nuget.org/packages/NTypewriter/

https://www.nuget.org/packages/NTypewriter.CodeModel.Roslyn/

And how to do that you can see here:

[DocumentationGenerator/Program.cs](../DocumentationGenerator/Program.cs)

The documentation page for "Built-in functions" is generated by the above CLI program.
